                <h1>Chance</h1>
                <p>Chance was founded by me in 2019. The story behind this was that many students on the street wereÂ forced by their parents to act like homeless people and bag other people for money. I feel that if those children take the proper way, they will have a good future. Chance is a one-day program that was organized for 50 street children. The goal of this event is to provide them the opportunity to enjoy a one-day education and to encourage them to attend school. Kids got new haircuts and outfits, played games, and ate pizza at this event. I truly hope that this move will inspire them to further their studies and help this country.</p>
