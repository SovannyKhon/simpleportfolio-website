                <h1>Rodwell's Abassador</h1>
                <p>In my senior year, I was selected as a Rodwell's Ambassador. My responsibilities as an RA involve helping fellow students in the classroom and organizing various activities such as conferences, college fairs, meet-and-greet sessions, and roundtable discussions. As a Rodwell Ambassador, I was responsible for building a supportive academic environment and coordinating engaging activities that improved students' entire educational experience.</p>
