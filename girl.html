                <h1>Girl in code</h1>
                <p>Girls in Code is a non-profit organization founded in 2020 by me. This project was inspired by my own experience as the only girl in my first coding class. The goal of the project is to encourage women to major in computer science. Girls in Code had established a space where women could feel empowered and at peace with their passion. In 2020, I hosted three podcasts for postgraduate high school students in the Rodwell Learning Center, though online. Women who succeeded in coding, as well as women who had dropped out, were addressed. The goal of this podcast is to share real-life experiences with the next generation as they prepare for their coding journey. </p>
