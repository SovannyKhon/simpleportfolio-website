                <h1>Vulonteers</h1>
                <p>Following the problems caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, I volunteered to help the Seametrey Children's Village prepare schools for reopening. The value of a safe and clean learning environment, my volunteer activities were geared at supporting the community and assisting in the pupils' return to normality. This effort reflects a dedication to community well-being and a belief in how important education plays in children's lives, especially in difficult situations.</p>

                <h1>Work</h1>
                <p>I've worked as a barista at Rean Caf√© in Rodwell Learning Center for the past four years, beginning in my junior year of high school. Aside from the usual tasks of making and serving coffee, my position involves creating a pleasant and friendly environment for students, which is comparable to a home away from home. As a barista, I take happiness not just in brewing great coffee but also in creating an environment that enriches the whole experience for students.</p>
