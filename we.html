                <h1>WECode</h1>
                <p>I am one of forty women from across the world who chose to become WECdoe Tech Fellows to work with women at Harvard to promote the world's largest women-run conference, the WECode Technology Conference 2023, which was held at Harvard University. My role as a WECode tech fellow is to be a leader for women in Cambodia and to encourage them to attend the conference. Many fantastic keynotes at this conference motivated other women to succeed in their coding careers. As a WECode Tech fellow and participant at this conference, I met many amazing women and was impressed by all of the keynote presenters who discussed the best methods for women to be successful in coding.</p>
